Subject: [PATCH 2/2] fix: announce exfat support with alternative drivers

Linux kernel has only since 5.4 (GKI 1.0) included native exfat drivers. Samsung has (and still includes) included their own "sdfat" driver. Sony has similarly included a "texfat" driver.

LineageOS seems to include additional checks which I do not want to properly implement, therefore we can just fake exfat support when sdfat or texfat are available and deal with that crap later with phh's AOSP patches.
