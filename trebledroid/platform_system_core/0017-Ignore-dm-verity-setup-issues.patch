Subject: [PATCH 17/27] Ignore dm-verity setup issues

On Amlogic STB Android 9 vendor, no boot device is setup
(fstab doesn't use /dev/block/by-name but more direct mappings)
that means that libavb can't access the partition by-name, thus failing
to read vbmeta & co, and thus failing setting up dm-verity.

We don't care much about dm-verity so let's just ignore this
